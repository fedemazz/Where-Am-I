# Where-Am-I
Where Am I is a free browser app, developed by me and other two collegues for the course "Tecnologie Web 3 yr. Informatica per il Management". 

The app is divided into two parts: browser and editor.
The editor allows anyone, after logging in via google, to upload video guides on youtube regarding a point of interest.
The browser locates the user who uses the app and shows him the video guides of the points of interest near him.
